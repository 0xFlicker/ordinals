# Bitflick Code of Conduct

**v0.1 – Dictatorship, but make it friendly**

## Who We Are (So Far)

At the moment, Bitflick is mostly one person yelling into the decentralized void while writing TypeScript. There’s no formal “community” yet—just some open-source code, strong opinions about Bitcoin, and a deep desire to build something enduring with like-minded humans.

This document is less about policing behavior and more about setting the vibe we hope to scale into: respectful, curious, and low-drama. Think of it as a social README for future collaborators.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to be kind, collaborative, and mostly sane when interacting in this project. Whether you’re submitting a PR, opening an issue, or just vibing in the repo—please bring your best self (or at least your reasonably caffeinated one).

## What’s Encouraged

Here’s what we like to see:

- Clear, constructive feedback (bonus points for tact)
- Curiosity and willingness to learn (we're all figuring this out)
- Respect for differing opinions, tools, and keyboard layouts
- Helping others without being a know-it-all about it
- Remembering there's a person on the other side of the commit

## What’s Discouraged

Here’s what will get you booted or banned (and not in the fun, “we’re all banned from Twitter” way):

- Harassment, threats, or bigoted language
- Sexual content or jokes (this is a GitHub repo, not a dating website)
- Doxxing or sharing private info without consent
- General jerk behavior, including but not limited to trolling, flame wars, or "just playing devil’s advocate"

If your behavior would get you kicked out of my chat group, it’s probably not okay here either.

## How Enforcement Works

Currently, enforcement falls to the project lead (me, hi). If you act like a goblin, I reserve the right to banish you from the project with or without ceremony. If you’re not sure whether something’s appropriate, you can always ask—or better yet, just don’t be weird about it.

## Reporting Issues

Email `sysop@bitflick.xyz` if something needs to be addressed. Reports will be taken seriously and handled with discretion. If you’re reporting yourself preemptively, that’s… new. But appreciated?

## Long-Term Vision

This is a benevolent dictatorship _in waiting_. The goal is to cultivate a thriving community with shared governance. Until then, consider this the onboarding doc for future co-conspirators.
